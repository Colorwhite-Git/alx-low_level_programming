Variadic Functions

The syntax for defining a function to take a variable number or type of arguments is defined by ISO C. Variadic functions or varargs functions are the names given to such functions. You must instead use the variable arguments macros specified in stdarg.h since the language itself does not provide a way for such functions to access their optional arguments.

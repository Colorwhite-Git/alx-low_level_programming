*The Compiler* - This code write a script that compiles a C file but it does not link. 

A compiler is a software tool that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level representation or machine code that can be directly executed by a computer

Explore the various examples and concepts covered in the repository.

Prerequisites
To compile and run the C programs in this repository, you will need:

A C compiler such as GCC or Clang installed on your machine. You can check if the compiler is installed by running the following command:

css
Copy code
gcc --version
If the command is not recognized, you need to install a C compiler.

A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and edit C code. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Code::Blocks.

Compiling and Running
To compile and run a C program, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the C program:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/program
Compile the program using a C compiler (GCC in this example):

Copy code
gcc program.c -o program
Run the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./program
Contents

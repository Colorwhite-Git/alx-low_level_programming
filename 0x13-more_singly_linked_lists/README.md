Singly Linked Lists

A singly linked list is a data structure in C programming that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence. This README file provides an overview of singly linked lists, their operations, and how to implement them in C programming.


Basic Operations
The fundamental operations that can be performed on a singly linked list include:

Insertion: Adding a new node to the list.

Inserting at the beginning of the list.
Inserting at the end of the list.
Inserting after a specific node.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.

Deleting the first node.
Deleting the last node.
Deleting a specific node.
Traversal: Visiting each node in the list to perform operations on data.

Searching: Finding a node with a specific value.

Display: Printing the elements of the linked list.
